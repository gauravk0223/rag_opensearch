# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline with LangChain and OpenSearch

This repository implements a **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using [LangChain] and [OpenSearch](https://opensearch.org/). The pipeline enables efficient document ingestion, semantic chunking, vector storage, and intelligent retrieval for advanced NLP applications.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **PDF Loader:** Easily ingest and process PDF documents for downstream NLP tasks.
- **Semantic Chunking:** Breaks documents into meaningful chunks for improved retrieval accuracy.
- **OpenSearch Vector Store:** Utilizes OpenSearch as a scalable vector database for storing and searching document embeddings.
- **HNSW Indexing:** Implements Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for fast and accurate vector similarity search.
- **LangChain Prompt Integration:** Leverages prompts from the LangChain hub for flexible and customizable language model interactions.
