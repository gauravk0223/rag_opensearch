###Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline with LangChain and OpenSearch
##This repository implements a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain and OpenSearch. The pipeline enables efficient document ingestion, semantic chunking, vector storage, and intelligent retrieval for advanced NLP applications.

###Key Features

##PDF Loader: Easily ingest and process PDF documents for downstream NLP tasks.
##Semantic Chunking: Breaks documents into meaningful chunks for improved retrieval accuracy.
##OpenSearch Vector Store: Utilizes OpenSearch as a scalable vector database for storing and searching document embeddings.
##HNSW Indexing: Implements Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) algorithm for fast and accurate vector similarity search.
##LangChain Prompt Integration: Leverages prompts from the LangChain hub for flexible and customizable language model interactions.
